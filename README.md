# [2020 Delta Airlines Network Performance and Resilience Dashboard with Tableau](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/DL-performance-dashboard)

## Context: 
- This dashboard and report is created as part of experiential learning at University of Illinois - Chicago, Liautaud Graduate Business School, course IDS.561 Data Visualization.

## Problem:
- While delays have always been a significant challenge in airline passenger satisfaction, since 2020, airlines have suffered from massive and dynamic paradigm changes in the market, which in turn leads to worsening delay performance. Airline stakeholders in both network planning and operations need to be able to assess departure delay performance for future operations.

## Solution:
- Visual, interactive dashboard and storytelling with data for non-technical personnel through Tableau, allowing for quick and intuitive conveyance of information to key stakeholders.
- Note that in order to open .twbx Tableau file in repo, you will need to have a Tableau license.
